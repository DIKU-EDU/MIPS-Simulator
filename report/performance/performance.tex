Although the primary objective of the simulator is not the performance, it is
an interesting aspect to study.\\
The pipeline approach of the simulator takes a lot of processing to perform,
and is implemented only for academic purposes -- to study the state and behaviour
of the processor. It goes without saying that the pipeline is not needed to
emulate the target CPU, as the emulated instructions are not held back by a time
restricting clock, nor do they have to wait for result from the previous instruction to
continue.\\
