\subsection*{Updated Problem Statement}
Is it possible to implement a pipelined MIPS simulator, with a memory-management
unit, memory-mapped IO, and full exception support, to fully support the
current version of KUDOS?

\subsection*{Target Audience and Prerequisites}
This report is intended for anyone interested in computer architecuture, with
the desire to expand the knowledge on the inner workings of MIPS32 processors.\\
The reader is expected to have either recently have taken a computer architecture course
or read \textit{Computer Organization And Design: The Hardware/Software Interface, 5th
edition, by David A. Petterson and John L. Hennessy}, particularly focusing on
the instruction pipelining within the processing unit.\\
Additionally, some fundamental understanding of computer hardware and related lingo is required,
as well as a basic understanding of programming languages and data-structures.

\subsection*{Downloading and building the simulator}
The simulator can be downloaded and built using:
\begin{verbatim}
$ git clone https://github.com/JanmanX/MIPS-Simulator.git
$ cd MIPS-Simulator/
$ make
\end{verbatim}
The simulator should be built in the \texttt{./bin/} directory as \texttt{mips-sim}.\\
A few test-programs are supplied along the simulator. These must be compiled
using a cross-compiler. A shell-script installing the cross-compiler is supplied
along side the simulator:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./tools/cross_compiler.sh
...
$ ./run_tests.sh
\end{verbatim}
\subsection*{Running the simulator}
The simulator has a variety of command-line options, which can all be listed
using the \texttt{-h} or \texttt{--help} flag.\\
Running the simulator can be as simple as only giving the program path as the first
command-line argument:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./bin/mips-sim tests/test_add_addiu.elf
$ echo $?
60
\end{verbatim}
To run a program with debugging enabled, the \texttt{-d} flag is supplied, which
will let the user step the instructions:
\begin{verbatim}
$ ./bin/mips-sim -d tests/test_add_addiu.elf
PC: 0x80010000
0x2408000A	ADDIU  rs = zero = 0x00000000,  rt = t0 = 0x00000000,  imm = 0x0000000A
> q
\end{verbatim}
